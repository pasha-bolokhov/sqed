\@doendnote{endnote1}{ Throughout this paper, we use predominantly the notations of Wess and Bagger \cite {Wess:1992cp}. Appendix \ref {app_conventions} summarizes these conventions as well as few cases where we deviate from them. }
\@doendnote{endnote2}{ Our notations in this paper for the background vectors deviate from those of \cite {GrootNibbelink:2004za}. We use $ n $ with subscripts for the backgrounds, and capital $ N_\pm $ for the emerging linear combinations of them.}
