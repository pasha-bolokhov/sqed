\centerline{\large\bf Abstract}
In this work, the Supersymmetric Quantum Electordynamics (SQED) is extended by 
the interactions with external tensor backgrounds, which are 
assumed to be generated by some Lorentz-noninvariant 
dynamics at an ultraviolet scale $M$. Exact supersymmetry is compatible with operators 
of dimension five and higher, thus providing a solution 
to the naturalness problem in the 
Lorentz-violating sector. All dimension five and six 
Lorentz-violating operators in SQED are classified.
The Lorentz-noninvariant extension at dimension five level 
is studied in detail, including the 
renormalization group evolution of Lorentz violating operators 
and their observational consequences. 
Once supersymmetry is broken, dimension three operators are 
allowed and their size is controlled by the scale of the 
soft-breaking masses. The low-energy precision measurements 
set typical constraints on the size of the dimension 
five operators at $10^{-10}-10^{-5}$ level in units of the inverse Planck mass.

\section{Introduction}
\label{Intro}


The history of physics knows many examples when 
some symmetries of nature that were assumed to be exact have fallen under
the experimental scrutiny. Study of the consequences of such breaking 
often provides an important insight into the dynamics at high-energy scales,
as it was exemplified with the weak-scale dynamics of the Standard Model (SM)
and its matter content through the search and discovery of P and CP violation. 
Lorentz symmetry is the fundamental ingedient in the construction of the 
fundamental theories of nature, and no breakdown of this symmetry has been 
observed to date. Nevertheless, there is a growing interest to 
a possibility of Lorentz Violation (LV), as precision of 
tests of Lorentz symmetry can provide information about the 
dynamics far beyond the electroweak scale. 


%In the recent few years it has been widely realized that precision of
%current cosmological and astrophysical observations and 
%sensitivity of modern experiments have reached the accuracy
%which allows to question if one of the most sacred symmetries of Nature 
%--- Lorentz symmetry --- is an exact symmetry.
%So more interest has been drawn to the subject, as various patterns of 
%violation of Lorentz invariance can be studied and constrained, without
%proper knowledge of the inherent theory which may be responsible for deviations
%from Lorentz symmetry.
%Recent years have seen an increase in number of theoretical studies 
%of Lorentz non-invariant physics as well as intensified efforts to detect
%a signature of the Lorentz symmetry breakdown  in terrestrial, astrophysical and
%cosmological settings \cite{Kost1,CG,Jacobsonreview,PhysToday}. 
The recently intensified  interest to 
theories with Lorentz violation is stimulated by several seemingly 
unrelated motives. Firstly, a combination of different sets of 
cosmological data indicate that the dominant 
component of the energy density in the Universe is the dark energy, 
which can be either a cosmological constant or some energy density 
associated with the new infrared degree of freedom such as {\em e.g.} 
an ultra-light scalar field (quintessence). 
The time evolution of quintessence creates a preferred frame 
which could in principle be detected as a Lorentz non-symmetric background if 
quintessence couples to the Standard Model fields. 
Secondly, string theory predicts a number of massless or nearly massless 
moduli fields with some of them carrying open Lorentz indices. The well studied 
example, a non-vanishing background of the antisymmetric field $B_{\mu\nu}$
on the brane (for a review see \cite{DN})
leads to the effects that are seen at low energies as an effective 
violation of Lorentz symmetry. Thirdly, there has been a number of 
conjectures that a quantum nature of gravity at distances $1/M_{\rm Pl}$ 
can manifest itself at lower energies through the  Lorentz breaking signatures 
in the dispersion relation for particles 
that scale as $E^2(E/M_{\rm Pl})^n$, $n \geq 1$, (See, e.g. \cite{lcq} and references therein), 
and can become comparable to the square of particle's mass if energy $E$ is large. 
Although such conjectures are undoubtedly 
very speculative, if true they would provide a very powerful tool of probing 
ultra-short distance scales via Lorentz-violating physics.  Direct experimental constraints on 
modifications of dispersion relations come from astrophysical processes 
\cite{CFJ,AmC,Ted1,GK,Kost2,Sarkar} and terrestrial 
clock comparison experiments \cite{clock1,clock2,Vuc,MP:}. In both cases a
typical sensitivity to the size of the coefficients in 
front of these operators is at the level of $10^{-5}/M_{\rm Pl}$ creating 
a definite problem for those theories that predict $\sim 1/M_{\rm Pl}$ effects.

In effective field theory framework the breakdown of Lorentz 
symmetry can be described by the presence of external tensors fixed 
by some unspecified dynamics and coupled to the operators of the
Standard Model. It is very useful to characterize the operators by the powers 
of increasing dimension as it gives a first guidance to the 
possible scaling of the LV effects with the ultraviolet scale $M$. 
In quantum electrodynamics the generic expansion
in terms of the gauge invariant operators starts at dimension three (see {\em e.g.}
\cite{Kost1}),
\begin{equation}
{\cal L}_{\rm QED}^{(3)} =
-a_\mu \bar \psi \gamma_\mu \psi
- b_\mu \bar \psi \gamma^\mu \gamma_5 \psi - \frac{1}{2}H_{\mu\nu}\bar
\psi \sigma^{\mu\nu} \psi - k_\mu \epsilon^{\mu\nu\kappa\lambda}
A_\nu \partial_\kappa A_\lambda, 
\label{LVqed}
\end{equation}
where $\psi$ is the electron Dirac spinor, $A_\mu$ is the
electromagnetic vector-potential, $a_{\mu}$,
$b_\mu$, $k_\mu$ and $H_{\mu\nu}$ are external vector and
anti-symmetric tensor backgrounds that introduce the preferred
frame and therefore break Lorentz invariance. Note that a possible
coupling to the vector current, $a_\mu \bar \psi \gamma^\mu \psi$,
can be removed by introducing a space-time dependent phase for a
fermion field. The last term in the Lagrangian density is gauge
invariant up to a total derivative which can be neglected. 

Even at this level, there is a problem in ascribing the Lorentz breaking 
to the dynamics at some ultraviolet (UV) scale $M$. If Lorentz symmetry is broken by 
some dynamics at the high-energy scale, from simple dimensional counting  
one might expect that $a_\mu,~b_\mu,... \sim O(M)$
and therefore LV is very large and unadmissible. For example, a Higgs mechanism 
allowing for a condensation of the vector field $V_{\mu}\sim M n_\mu$, where $n_\mu$ is a 
"unit" vector \cite{Kostelecky:1989jw}, can create disastrous consequences in the observable sector if 
$V_\mu$ is coupled to a non-conserved current, {\em i.e.} $\bar \psi \gamma_\mu\gamma_5 \psi$.  
One can hope that operators of dimension three and four are forbidden by 
some symmetry arguments or tuned to be small so that the LV effects 
first appear at dimension five level \cite{MP:} 
or higher. However, such hopes can be shattered by quatum loop effects that 
can dimensionally transmute higher dimensional operators into lower dimensional operators
with a square divergence,
\begin{equation}
[LV]_{\rm dim~3} \,~\sim~\, ({\rm loop~factor}) \, 
\frac{\Lambda_{UV}^2}{M} 
\times [LV]_{{\rm dim}~5}. 
\label{transmute}
\end{equation}
Here $[LV]_{\rm dim~3(5)}$ represent generic LV operators at dimension
3 and 5 levels. If the scale of the ultraviolet cutoff $\Lambda_{UV}$
is of the order $M$, then huge dimension three operators will be
generated. In that case, all higher dimensional operators would also 
have to be tuned, leaving no room for LV physics. This is the problem
of naturalness in the LV sector. It can be avoided if the quadratic
divergences are suppressed by certain symmetry arguments. In
Ref. \cite{MP:} it has been shown that the dimension five LV operators
coupled to fully symmetric three-index traceless tensors are protected
against developing quadratic divergences inside loops. This solves the
naturalness problem only partially, as there are no arguments why
dimension 3 and 4 operators cannot be induced at the tree level, which
have to be tuned to experimentally acceptable values  "by hand".  

In recent paper \cite{GrootNibbelink:2004za}, it has been shown that
supersymmetry provides a powerful selection  rule on admissible forms
of the LV interactions. In particular, it has been shown that  in the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) the requirements of
supersymmetry and gauge invariance restrict the LV operators to be
dimension five or higher. Once supersymmetry is softly broken, one
can expect the stabilization of the UV divergences by the scale of the
soft-breaking masses. Hence this might lead to the solution of the question
why the lower dimensional LV operators are so much suppressed as
compared to their natural scale. 

Explicit example of how  supersymmetry (SUSY) restricts the form of possible 
Lorentz-noninvariant interactions and leads to a drammatic numerical change 
for the predicted observables can be seen on the example of the
non-commutative field theories.  At a fundamental level, the
noncommmutative background  
$\theta_{\mu\nu}$ enters via the Moyal product. It has the canonical 
dimension $-2$, and the scale of the noncommutativity $\Lambda_{NC}
\sim(\theta)^{-1/2}$ gives a natural UV scale. 
As a result, a linearized expansion in $\theta$ is justified 
as long as the momenta of fields  are much smaller than $\Lambda_{NC}$. 
This expansion leads to a series of dimension 6 operators
that at the tree level induce the interaction between the spins of 
particles and $\theta$-background \cite{MPR1}, $H_{\mu\nu} \sim \Lambda_{IR}^3\theta_{\mu\nu}$,
with $ \Lambda_{IR}$ being the relevant infrared scale, such as $\Lambda_{QCD}$ 
in the case of hadrons. However, it can be shown that loop effects in the 
non-commutative field theories lead to quadratically divergent integrals \cite{UCSC},
$H_{\mu\nu} \sim \Lambda_{IR}\Lambda_{UV}^2\theta_{\mu\nu}$, essentially
invalidating the expansion in terms of $\theta_{\mu\nu}$. 
If the scale of the cutoff is very high, e.g. comparable to $\Lambda_{NC}$, 
then the resulting spin anisotropy is very large and certainly excluded 
by experiment. However, this conclusion is premature as 
one can argue that the operator $\bar q \sigma_{\mu\nu} q$ 
is incompatible with SUSY \cite{MPR2} and thus should not be induced 
in the domain of the loop momenta higher than the SUSY breaking. 
This means that the cutoff is essentially coincides with the 
energy splitting between fermions and bosons, $\Lambda_{UV} \sim m_{\rm soft}$. 
This has been confirmed by an explicit two-loop calculation in non-commutative 
QED \cite{WMC2}. With the quadratic divergence stabilized at 
$m_{\rm soft}\sim 1~{\rm TeV}$,
the Planck scale non-commutativity is safely within the experimental 
bounds. This example illustrates that the existence of SUSY is important in 
understanding the actual size of the expected LV effects. 

The purpose of this work is to analyze in detail LV operators in 
the supersymmetric quantum electrodynamics (SQED),
as a miniature version of the LV MSSM, prove the absence of the
naturalness problem in the LV sector, and derive phenomenological
constraints on LV parameters in SQED.  Following
Ref. \cite{GrootNibbelink:2004za}, we  parametrize all dimension five
operators in the SQED sector  by three vectors $N^{\mu}$,
$N^{\mu}_+$ and $N^{\mu}_-$
that enter in the LV operators composed  of vector superfield (photons and photinos) and chiral
superfields corresponding to left- and right-handed (s)electrons. 
Besides these three vectors, there is one irreducible tensor of rank three $T^{\mu\nu\lambda}$ 
that parametrizes additional LV effects in the vector multiplet sector. 
We introduce these operators in the superfield formalism, and then
derive their component form. We observe that upon the use of the
equations of motion some parts of dimension five operators can be
reduced to dimension three LV operators, and the relation  
between them is controlled by the electron mass $m_e$,  
$[LV]_{\rm dim~3} \sim m_e^2 [LV]_{\rm dim~5}$.

The main emphasis of this study is on the quantum effects. We derive the
renormalization group evolution for the LV operators, showing
explicitly that only the logarithmic divergences arise in the limit of
exact supersymmetry. We solve  one-loop renormalization equations
to obtain the low-energy values of LV parameters in terms of the
original values formulated at the UV scale $M$. We notice that the
photon LV operator mixes with one specific combination of  
chiral operators, symmetric under the charge conjugation. 

We further break supersymmetry in the matter sector by introducing the 
soft-breaking mass for scalar electrons and study the consequences for the 
LV operators. As expected, dimension three LV operators can now be induced, and the 
relation between the parameters is now given by 
$[LV]_{\rm dim~3} \sim m_{\rm soft}^2 [LV]_{\rm dim~5}$. 
Although a loop effect, this constitutes a dramatic enhancement over
the case with unbroken SUSY, as $ m_{\rm soft}^2/m_e^2 > 10^{10}$.  
The study of dimension 3 operators also raises the question of possibility of 
inducing  a Chern-Simons term from the radiative corrections.
Our analysis shows that the Chern-Simons term is not generated by 
radiative corrections in SQED with spontaneously broken SUSY.

We investigate phenomenological consequences of LV in the framework of
softly-broken SQED. The strongest constraints on the parameters of the
model come from the  (non)observation of the anomalous spin precession
around the direction given by the linear combination of the spatial
parts of $N$-vectors. We utilise other constraints as well,  
such as comparison of the anomalous magnetic moments of electrons and 
positrons. It is important to note that all constraints obtained in this 
work are the laboratory constraints, as the astrophysical and cosmological 
searches of LV are not sensitive to the effects induced by LV in SQED. 
Other questions considered in this work include the study of a possible $D$-term 
induced by the LV operators, and classification of the next order
dimension six operators in SQED. 

We present our results in the following order. Section II introduces
the LV operators and backgrounds at dimension 5 and 6.  Section III addresses the running of
LV dimension 5 operators in the exact SUSY limit. Section IV studies
the consequences of the soft SUSY breaking for the LV sector, and
derives RG equations for the induced dimension 3 LV operators.  In
section V we study the phenomenology of the model, and obtain 
predictions for the relevant LV observables. 
We reach our conclusions in section VI.  


\section{LV operators in SQED} 
\label{LVoperators}

Supersymmetric Quantum Electrodynamics (SQED) is described
by two chiral superfields $ \Phi_+ $ and $ \Phi_- $, that 
are oppositely charged under a U(1) gauge superfield $ V $: 
%%
%% The SQED lagrangian
\begin{eqnarray}
% first line
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm SQED} & =
&
\int d^4\theta\, \Big(
   \overline{\Phi}_+ e^{2eV} \Phi_+ ~+~
   \overline{\Phi}_- e^{-2eV} {\Phi}_-  \Big) \\

\overline{m}\, \overline{\Phi}_+\overline{\Phi}_- \Big)~, 
% third line
\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $ W_\alpha = - \frac{1}{4} \overline{D}{}^2 D_\alpha\, {V} $ 
is the super gauge invariant expression for the field strength. 
Throughout this paper, we use predominantly Wess and
Bagger notations \cite{Wess:1992cp}. The fermionic components of
superfields $ \Phi_+ $ and $ \Phi_- $ correspond to the left-handed
electron and right-handed charge-conjugated electron fields. With a   
slight abuse of the language, we call them the electron and positron 
superfields, or just the electron and the positron for brevity. We
define the charge of electron as $ e = - | e | $. 
Finally, $ m $ denotes the (complex) electron mass. 


LV extensions of SQED can be constructed as a series of effective
operators containing the superfields $\Phi_-$, $\Phi_+$,
% modified by PAB:
% $V$ and
gauge covariant derivatives $ \nabla_\alpha $, 
$ \overline{\nabla}_{\dot\alpha} $ and
%
{\em arbitrary} constant tensor coefficients with Lorentz indices 
that specify the
breakdown of Lorentz symmetry \cite{GrootNibbelink:2004za}. 
The general rules according to which LV operators should be
constructed are listed in Ref.\ \cite{MP:}. Before we give various
LV operators that can be written down within the context of SQED, we
describe our general construction principles. In this work we require
that all LV operators are  
\begin{enumerate}
\item supersymmetric, 
\item local super gauge invariant with chiral gauge parameters, 
\item have local component expressions. 
\end{enumerate}
Let us explain these conditions in somewhat more detail. First of all,
by supersymmetry we mean that the subalgebra 
\begin{equation}
\{ Q_\alpha, \overline{Q}_{\dot\alpha} \} = 
2 \sigma^\mu_{\alpha\dot{\alpha}} \, P_\mu
\end{equation}
of the super Poincar\'e algebra remains unbroken. If we assume that 
the breaking of the Lorentz symmetry is somehow 
{\em spontaneous}, we are guaranteed that
$\sigma^\mu_{\alpha\dot{\alpha}}$ represent the standard Pauli
matrices. However, if the breaking of Lorentz symmetry is {\em
explicit} from the outset of the theory, these objects are simply 
structure coefficients parameterizing this supersymmetry algebra. (In
this work we do not pursue this possibility further. Possible 
modifications of superalgebra by LV parameters was discussed in 
Ref. \cite{Berger:}) This assumption
allows us to perform our analysis using conventional superspace. 


The requirement of having a local component expression allows for a
conventional effective field theory interpretation of the Lagrangians that
we obtain. However, the locality of the component Lagrangian
does not necessarily imply that the superspace
expression of a given Lagrangian appears local \footnote{We would 
like to thank N.\ Arkani-Hamed for this comment.}. For example, the
electron mass term can be written in a seemingly non-local way  
\(
\int d^4 \theta\, m \, \Phi_- D^2/(- 4\Box) \Phi_+ + \text{h.c.}~.
\)
%
Finally, we require that LV operators preserve the standard local
super gauge transformations  
\begin{equation}
\Phi_\pm \rightarrow e^{\mp 2 e \Lambda} \, \Phi_\pm~, 
\qquad 
\overline{\Phi}_\pm \rightarrow e^{\mp 2 e \overline{\Lambda}} \, 
\overline{\Phi}_\pm~, 
\qquad 
V \rightarrow \Lambda + \overline{\Lambda}~, 
\label{Gauge}
\end{equation} 
with chiral parameter $\Lambda$. In particular, we do not allow for
non-local or non-chiral extensions of the gauge transformations as
seem to be required by non-commutative SUSY
\cite{Putz:2002ib,Mikulovic:2003sq}.  


As was shown in \cite{GrootNibbelink:2004za} these conditions 
combined impose strong restrictions on the number of LV terms of
a specific mass dimension one can write: no dimension three or four
LV operators can be written down within the context of the MSSM. 
Here we do not repeat all the arguments leading to this general claim,
but simply illustrate the underlying philosophy by showing that the CS
term (the last interaction in \eqref{LVqed}) does not have a SUSY
extension satisfying all three conditions stated above. The CS term is
a dimension three operator that is bilinear in the gauge field and
proportional to a vector, therefore the local superspace extension is 
\begin{equation}
{\cal L}_{\rm SCS}^{\rm local} = \int d^4 \theta \, 
V [ D_\alpha, \overline{D}_{\dot\alpha}] V~.
\end{equation} 
This is the only possible structure, as the insertion of an anti-commutator 
$\{D_\alpha, \overline{D}_{\dot\alpha}\}$ gives rise to a spacetime
total derivative immediately. By a component evaluation of this term
one may confirm that this operator indeed contains the CS term, which
is gauge invariant up to a total derivative. However, the
SUSY extension as a whole is not super gauge invariant: 
\begin{equation}
\delta {\cal L}_{\rm SCS}^{\rm local} 
= - 4 i\, \sigma_{\alpha\dot{\alpha}}^m\, 
\int d^4 \theta \, 
V\, \partial_m ( \overline{\, \Lambda} - \Lambda \,)~. 
\end{equation} 
Notice that this statement is independent of the Wess-Zumino
gauge, and that even under the restriction of  the super gauge
transformations to ordinary U(1) transformation 
($\Lambda = i \,\alpha$) the supersymmetric extension of the CS term
fails to be gauge invariant.  


These arguments do not show that it is impossible to construct a super
gauge invariant extension of the CS term. Indeed, by inserting the
transversal projector 
$P_V = D^\alpha \overline{D}{}^2 D_\alpha/(-8 \Box)$
we obtain a manifest super gauge invariant expression 
\begin{equation}
{\cal L}_{\rm SCS}^{\rm non-local} ~=~ \int d^4 \theta \, 
V\, P_V\,  [ D_\alpha, \overline{D}_{\dot\alpha}] V
~=~
2 \int d^4 \theta \, 
\overline{W}_{\dot\alpha} \frac 1{\Box} W_\alpha
~.
\end{equation} 
This expression is clearly appears to be non-local in superspace, but
the CS term itself is still local. In fact, because it was already
gauge invariant, the insertion of $P_V$ did not affect its expression
at all. However, other terms in the component expressions are
non-local because they contain $1/\Box$ explicitly. Hence, as
asserted, the CS term does not allow for a SUSY extension that is super
gauge invariant and has a local component expression. 




\subsection{CPT-violating dimension five LV operators}
\label{Dim5LV}


There are only three different types of LV operators satisfying the 
above requirements in SQED at the
dimension five level. In this subsection we give their superfield
expressions, while their component forms can be found in Section
\ref{Phenomenology}. The first type is the electron and positron 
superfield operators  
%%
%% the electron and positron operators
\begin{equation}
\label{LV_matter}
  \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{LV}}^{\mathrm{matter}} ~=~ 
\frac{1}{M}\,   \int d^4\theta \Big\{ 
% electron
N_+^\mu\, \overline{\Phi}_+ e^{2eV} i \nabla_\mu \Phi_+ 
% positron
~+~ N_{-}^\mu\, \overline{\Phi}_- e^{-2eV} i \nabla_\mu  {\Phi}_-
                 \Big\}~
\end{equation}
which are parameterized by two external real vectors $N_\pm^\mu$.  
The super gauge covariant spacetime derivative 
$\nabla_\mu   =  - \frac{i}{4} 
\bar{\sigma}_\mu^{\dot{\alpha}\alpha}
\{ \nabla_\alpha, \overline{\nabla}_{\dot{\alpha}} \} 
$ 
is defined in terms of the super gauge covariant derivatives 
$\nabla_\alpha$ and $\overline{\nabla}_{\dot{\alpha}}$. Their precise
form depends on the super gauge transformation properties of the
object that they act on. For example, we define 
\begin{equation}
\nabla_\alpha \Psi_\pm = 
e^{\mp 2eV} D_\alpha \big( e^{\pm 2eV} \Psi_\pm \big)~, 
\qquad 
\overline{\nabla}_{\dot{\alpha}} \Psi_\pm =
\overline{D}_{\dot{\alpha}} \Psi_\pm~,
\end{equation} 
for generic superfields $\Psi_\pm$, that have the same gauge
transformations as the (chiral) superfields $\Phi_\pm$, see 
\eqref{Gauge}. 


For the photon super multiplet we have two possible operators. The
first operator is parameterized by a real vector background $N^\mu$.
We can give a K\"ahler-like representation of this vector operator as 
%% photon -- Kahler term
\begin{equation}
\label{LV_gauge}
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{LV\ dim\ 5}}^{\mathrm{gauge\ (V)}} = 
\frac 1M \int d^4\theta \, 
N^\kappa\, \overline{W} \bar{\sigma}_\kappa W~.   
\end{equation}
Using a superspace identity this operator can also be written as a
superpotential-like term  
\begin{equation}
\label{LV_gauge_Alt}
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{LV\ dim\ 5}}^{\mathrm{gauge\ (V)}} = 
- \frac {N_\kappa}{2 M} \epsilon^{\kappa\lambda\mu\nu} 
\Big( 
\int d^2\theta\, W \sigma_{\mu\nu} \partial_\lambda W ~+~
\int d^2\bar{\theta}\, \overline{W} \bar{\sigma}_{\mu\nu}
\partial_\lambda \overline{W} 
\Big)~.
\end{equation} 
Because $\int d\theta\, W\partial_\mu W$ is a total derivative, 
the most general LV superpotential-like term takes the form 
%% photon -- superpotential term
\begin{equation}
\label{LV_gauge_Tterm}
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{LV\ dim\ 5}}^{\mathrm{gauge\ (T)}} =
\frac 1{4M} 
\int d^2\theta \, T^{\lambda\, \mu\nu} \,
        W \sigma_{\mu\nu} \partial_\lambda W  
~+~ \frac 1{4M} 
\int d^2\theta \, \overline{T}^{\lambda\, \mu\nu} \,
        \overline{W} \bar{\sigma}_{\mu\nu} \partial_\lambda\overline{W}  
~.
\end{equation}
In principle this operator is parameterized by a complex rank-three
tensor $T^{\lambda\,\mu\nu}$, antisymmetric in the last two indices
$(\mu,\nu)$ due to the contraction with $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$. Notice, that
$\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ acts as a projector on the imaginary self-dual part
of the tensor because 
\(
\frac{1}{2}\,i\,\epsilon_{\mu\nu}{}^{\rho\sigma}
\sigma_{\rho\sigma} = \sigma_{\mu\nu}. 
\)
This implies that we may take $T^{\lambda\,\mu\nu}$ real. We can
constrain it further by requiring that 
\begin{equation}
T_\mu^{\phantom{\mu}\mu\rho} = 0~,
 \qquad 
\epsilon_{\kappa\lambda\rho\sigma}\, T^{\lambda\,\rho\sigma}  =  0~.
\end{equation} 
The first condition arises because the contraction of any trace part of
$T^{\lambda\,\mu\nu}$ of the operator \eqref{LV_gauge_Tterm} vanishes, as
\(
\int d^2\theta \, W\sigma^{\mu\nu} \partial_\nu W + 
\int d^2\theta \, \overline{W} \bar\sigma^{\mu\nu} \partial_\nu
\overline{W} = 0. 
\)
The second condition ensures that the LV due to a vector 
background is entirely accounted for by \eqref{LV_gauge_Alt}.


In a non-abelian theory, operator 
\eqref{LV_gauge_Tterm} cannot exist because 
%both formulations are not
%equivalent anymore, because only \eqref{LV_gauge} can be written down: 
$W_\alpha$'s are not gauge invariant but only gauge covariant.
Thus, to maintain gauge invariance, any derivative acting on it has to
be replaced by the corresponding super gauge derivative. 
In particular, a non-abelian generalization of 
 (\ref{LV_gauge_Tterm}) would have to contain the covariant
derivative $\nabla_\mu$.  But then the integrand would not be chiral as 
\begin{equation}
\overline{D}_{\dot\gamma} \nabla_\mu W_\alpha = 
-i e\, (\epsilon \bar\sigma_\mu)_{\dot\gamma}{}^\beta\, 
\Big( W_\alpha W_\beta + W_\beta W_\alpha \Big) \neq 0~. 
\end{equation} 
Therefore, in the non-Abelian case one can not write down
superpotential-like LV terms for gauge multiplets, and only 
the K\"ahler-like terms \eqref{LV_gauge} are allowed. 

We have listed all possible dimension five operators in SQED framework.
These results have been reported before in the MSSM setting \cite{GrootNibbelink:2004za}.
All operators of dimension 5, listed in this section, break CPT invariance. 
The CPT-conserving LV opearators start at dimension 6 level. 
For the matter of completeness, we now classify all dimension 
six Lorentz-violating operators compatible with SQED. 
However, our main analysis on the quantum loop effects and observational 
implications will be done with dimension five
operators \eqref{LV_matter}, \eqref{LV_gauge} and \eqref{LV_gauge_Tterm}.


\subsection{CPT-conserving dimension six LV operators}
\label{Dim6}


%In the previous section we have given the dimension five LV operators
%for SQED. 
%These results have been reported before in the MSSM 
%setting \cite{GrootNibbelink:2004za}, in this section we list all
%possible Lorentz violating operators of dimension six. 

Let us start by considering possible superpotential-like terms. 
To obtain dimension six operators in the Lagrangian density, 
one has to consider the superpotential at dimension five level, 
{\em i.e.} two dimensions higher than the standard mass term $m \Phi_-\Phi_+$. 
Because of the chirality condition imposed on the superpotential,
gauge invariance and the absence of 
fermionic LV backgrounds,  all possible terms have to be build out of the
(dimension two) operator $\Phi_+ \Phi_-$ and the (dimension three)
operator $W_\alpha W_\beta$, with possible derivative insertions in  
the latter. Omitting all Lorentz-preserving terms in the superpotential, we arrive at
the following set of the LV operators at dimension six level, 
\begin{gather} 
{\cal L}_{\rm{LV\ dim\ 6}}^{\rm{super}} ~=~ \frac{1}{M^2}
\int d^2 \theta \, \Big( 
A^{\mu\nu} \, \Phi_+ \Phi_-\, W \sigma_{\mu\nu} W ~+~ 
B^{\mu\nu} \, W \sigma_{\mu\nu} \Box W ~+~ 
C^{\mu\nu} \, W \sigma_{\mu\rho} \partial_\nu \partial^\rho W 
\nonumber \\[2ex]
~+~ 
S^{\mu\nu}\, W \partial_\mu \partial_\nu W ~+~ 
T^{\mu\nu\, \rho\sigma} \, 
W \sigma_{\mu\nu} \partial_\rho \partial_\sigma W 
\Big) ~+~ \text{h.c.}~. 
\label{LV_dim6_Fterm}
\end{gather}
The dimensionless matrices $A, B, C, S$ and the tensor $T$ are all complex,
and satisfy the symmetry properties: $A^{\mu\nu} = -A^{\nu\mu}$, 
$B^{\mu\nu} = -B^{\nu\mu}$, 
$S^{\mu\nu} =S^{\nu\mu}$ and 
$T^{\mu\nu\, \rho\sigma} = -T^{\nu\mu\, \rho\sigma} = 
T^{\mu\nu\, \sigma\rho}$. Moreover, the parts which are symmetric
should also be traceless: $S^\mu{}_\mu=0$ and 
$T^{\mu\nu\, \rho}{}_\rho = 0$. Finally,  
$\epsilon_{\mu\nu\sigma\tau}T^{\mu\nu\, \sigma\rho} = 0$ ensures that
the tensor does not mix with the matrix $C$. 
As mentionned before, superpotential terms \eqref{LV_dim6_Fterm} can be represented 
as an integral over the full superspace 
by factoring out $-\frac 14 \overline{D}{}^2$. This can be done in various ways
leading to seemingly different expressions for these operators. 
Since the superpotential expression above defines these 
operators uniquely, there is no need to give full superspace representations of
these operators here. 


Aside from the operators \eqref{LV_dim6_Fterm}, we can 
construct gauge invariant LV operators from the (dimension two)
building blocks  
$\overline{\Phi}_\pm e^{\pm 2e V} \Phi_\pm$, $\Phi_- \Phi_+$, 
$\overline{\Phi}_- \overline{\Phi}_+$, $D_\alpha W_\beta$ and
$\overline{D}_{\dot\alpha} \overline{W}_{\dot\beta}$ with possible
gauge covariant derivatives inserted. From the identity 
\(
[ \nabla_\mu, \nabla_\nu] \Phi_\pm = \pm e \, 
(\epsilon^T \sigma)^{\alpha\beta} \nabla_\alpha( W_\beta \Phi_\pm)
\)
we infer that 
\begin{equation}
\int d^4\theta\, \overline{\Phi}_\pm e^{\pm 2eV} 
[ \nabla_\mu, \nabla_\nu] \Phi_\pm  
= \int d^4\theta\, \Phi_- [ \nabla_\mu, \nabla_\nu] \Phi_+ = 0~. 
\end{equation} 
Moreover, full superspace integrals of 
$\Phi_- \Phi_+\, D_\alpha W_\beta$, 
$\Phi_- \Phi_+\, \overline{D}_{\dot\alpha} \overline{W}_{\dot\beta}$ 
and their conjugates vanish as well. Therefore, the most general
(genuine K\"ahler and non-reducible to superpotential) dimension six LV matter Lagrangian is given by 
\begin{gather}
{\cal L}_{\rm LV\ dim\ 6}^{\rm matter}  = \frac{1}{M^2}
\int d^4 \theta\, \Big[ 
\overline{\Phi}_\pm e^{\pm 2eV} \Phi_\pm \, 
\Big( 
A_\pm^{\mu\nu} \, D \sigma_{\mu\nu} W + 
\overline{A}_\pm^{\mu\nu} \, \overline{D} \bar\sigma_{\mu\nu} \overline{W}
\Big) 
\nonumber \\[2ex]
~+~ S_\pm^{\mu\nu}\,  \overline{\Phi}_\pm e^{\pm 2eV} 
\lbrace \nabla_\mu, \nabla_\nu \rbrace \Phi_\pm  
~+~ Z^{\mu\nu}\,  \Phi_- \lbrace \nabla_\mu, \nabla_\nu \rbrace \Phi_+ 
~+~ \overline{Z}^{\mu\nu}\,  
\overline{\Phi}_- \lbrace \nabla_\mu, \nabla_\nu \rbrace \overline{\Phi}_+ 
 \Big]~, 
 \label{LV_dim6_Dterm}
\end{gather}
where $S_\pm^{\mu\nu}$ real symmetric traceless matrices, and 
$Z^{\mu\nu}$ a complex symmetric traceless matrix and
$\overline{Z}^{\mu\nu}$ its complex conjugate. 




In this section, we do not give the explicit component expressions of
these supersymmetric operators, but it is not hard to see that
operators like 
 $ F_{\mu\rho}F_{\nu\sigma}F^{\rho\sigma} $
or
  $ F_{\rho\sigma}F^{\rho\sigma}F_{\mu\nu} $, 
do not arise. This might seem surprising, since such terms do appear in
the investigations of non-commutative  supersymmetric models and SQED in
particular \cite{Putz:2002ib,Mikulovic:2003sq}. However, there is no
inconsistency here: as pointed out in \cite{Mikulovic:2003sq} the
Seiberg-Witten map for non-commutative supersymmetric gauge 
theories cannot simultaneously have local and chiral gauge
transformations and be invariant under conventional supersymmetry. 
However, in our construction we have insisted on these three
principles. Thus our framework is more restrictive and do not allow 
for such operators. 




\section{Quantum corrections in the presence of LV}
\label{quantum}




\subsection{Absence of a LV induced D-term and gauge anomalies}
\label{noDterm}

In this subsection want to show that the dimension five LV operators
discussed in section \ref{Dim5LV} do not lead to dangerous power 
law divergences in SQED. Before we enter this analysis, we would like
to emphasize why this is an important issue. One of the main reasons
why supersymmetry is conventionally introduced is that 
supersymmetric theories are free of destabilizing quadratic
divergences. There is of course one well-know 
exception to this assertion, the $D$-term of a U(1) vector multiplet,
which is in principle quadratically divergent at one loop. 
However, in any supersymmetric theory that is free of anomalies the
coefficient in front of the $D$ term vanishes identically. The introduction of the
higher dimensional LV operators could upset the fine balance of the
cancellation of the $D$-term, reintroducing the quadratic
divergence. We will now show that such destabilizing effects do not
arise. 


To begin this investigation we specify the relevant Feynman rules. 
The matter LV operators \eqref{LV_matter} can be decomposed into
a modification of the quadratic part of the chiral multiplets 
\begin{equation} 
\int d^4\theta\, 
\overline{\Phi}_\pm 
\label{LV_matter_int00}
\Big( 1 + \frac{N_\pm^\mu}{M} \, i \partial_\mu  \Big) 
\Phi_\pm~, 
\end{equation}
and their gauge interactions
\begin{equation} 
\raisebox{-1ex}{\includegraphics[height=1cm,keepaspectratio]{diag_inter1.ps}}
\quad = \quad 
\int d^4\theta\, 
\overline{\Phi}_\pm 
\Big(  e^{\pm 2 e V} - 1 \Big) 
\Big( 1 + \frac{N_\pm^\mu}{M} \, i \partial_\mu  \Big) 
\Phi_\pm
\label{LV_matter_int1}
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
\raisebox{-1ex}{\includegraphics[height=1
cm,keepaspectratio]{diag_inter2.ps}}
\quad = \quad 
\pm \int d^4\theta\, 
\frac {e N^\mu \bar\sigma_\mu^{\dot\alpha\alpha}}{2M}\, 
\overline{\Phi}_\pm 
e^{\pm 2eV} 
( \overline{D}_{\dot\alpha} D_\alpha V) 
\Phi_\pm~. 
\label{LV_matter_int2}
\end{equation} 
For most of the phenomenological applications it is sufficient to include 
only first order terms in expansion over LV parameters. For the study of the 
$D$-term however, higher order terms in LV has to be taken into account as well.
It proves useful to combine quadratic terms (\ref{LV_matter_int00}) into a 
resummed  propagators. 
\begin{equation} 
\raisebox{-1ex}{\includegraphics[width=1.4cm,keepaspectratio]{diag_resmprop.ps}}
\quad = \quad 
\frac 1{\Box}\,  \frac 1{1 +  \frac{ N_\pm^\mu} M \, i\partial_\mu}~. 
\end{equation} 
These propagators are better behaved in the UV, because of the additional 
derivative in the denominator. 
Since the moimentum scale involved in the $D$-term calculation is far above the soft 
breaking scale, we ignore soft scalar masses and the electron mass.
It is easy to notice that the LV part of the resummed propagator  
is canceled exactly by the corresponding part of the interactions \eqref{LV_matter_int1} when 
these propagators are attached to their $\Phi_\pm$-leg. Diagrammatically this may be
represented as  
\begin{equation}
\raisebox{-1ex}{\includegraphics[height=1cm,keepaspectratio]{diag_resum1.ps}}
\quad = \quad 
\raisebox{-1ex}{\includegraphics[height=1.1cm,keepaspectratio]{diag_resum2.ps}}
~. 
\label{ResummedPropVer}
\end{equation}
This shows that for single insertions of interactions (\ref{LV_matter_int1}) and \eqref{LV_matter_int2}
only the latter survives, leading to
logarithmic renormalization of the dimension five LV operators, which
will be studied in the next subsection. 
Another immediate consequence of (\ref{ResummedPropVer}) is that LV does not 
modify the cancellation of the Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) $D$-term at one loop. Indeed, the 
$\overline{D}_{\dot\alpha} D_\alpha V$-proportional interaction 
gives a total derivative in the superspace when $\Phi_{\pm}$ fields are integrated out
and thus vanishes. 
The linear in $V$ part of interaction  \eqref{LV_matter_int1} 
could induce the $D$-term via the tadpole diagrams
obtained by closing the chiral loop in the diagrams above. However, cancellation 
property (\ref{ResummedPropVer}) reduces the tadpole with LV to a standard 
tadpole diagram in the Lorentz-preserving case, 
\begin{equation}
\raisebox{-2.5ex}{\includegraphics[height=1.2cm,keepaspectratio]{diag_FI1.ps}}
\quad = \quad 
\raisebox{-2.5ex}{\includegraphics[height=1.2cm,keepaspectratio]{diag_FI2.ps}}
\quad = \quad 0~,
\end{equation}
where the last diagram gives a vanishing $D$-term when both $\Phi+$ and $\Phi_-$ loops are 
taken into account. More generically, the $D$-term will vanish for any chiral field content, 
provided that the sum of all charges for chiralk fields is zero. 
Hence, to first order in the LV parameters, no extra quadratic divergences are introduced into SQED
by LV interactions. 

The situation becomes more complicated if we go to higher orders in 
the LV parameters and to higher loop orders: the arguments 
presented above are sufficient to
prove that to all orders no quadratic divergences arise, as long as we
ignore the second interaction structure \eqref{LV_matter_int2}. At two-loop 
level vertex \eqref{LV_matter_int2} introduces additional factors of $\overline{D}_{\dot\alpha}
D_\alpha$ into diagrams, and thereby raises 
the degree of divergence of a diagram by one, because 
\(
\{\overline{D}_{\dot\alpha}, D_\alpha\} = 
-2 i \sigma_{\alpha\dot\alpha}^\mu \partial_\mu~.
\) 
Unlike in the one-loop calculation of the FI tadpole, the
$\overline{D}_{\dot\alpha} D_\alpha$ derivatives may now act inside
the diagrams, and hence still lead to a potential power-like divergence. In addition, 
each of the internal propagator lines may be dressed with multiple LV
insertions. Even though the cancellation property we relied upon at one loop, Eq. (\ref{ResummedPropVer}), does 
not apply here,  luckily, one can show that at two (and higher) loops the effects of all such
possible insertions still cancel. The proof of this statement is similar to
the proof in a standard Lorentz preserving U(1) theory
\cite{Fischler:1981zk}. At two loops, there are two types of diagrams,
\begin{equation}
\raisebox{-2.5ex}{\includegraphics[height=1.2cm,keepaspectratio]{diag_2loop1.ps}}
\quad + \quad 
\raisebox{-2.5ex}{\includegraphics[height=1.2cm,keepaspectratio]{diag_2loop2.ps}}
~,
\end{equation} 
where the vertices with boxes denote either regular gauge interactions or
the ones given in \eqref{LV_matter_int2} whith the derivatives
$\overline{D}_{\dot\alpha} D_\alpha$ acting on the internal gauge lines. 
Using the diagrammatic result \eqref{ResummedPropVer}, the vertex of 
the first diagram with the external $V$ line and one adjacent chiral
line can be turned into an ordinary Lorentz-preserving combination. 
By partial integration on
the internal gauge line all (LV) operators can be moved away as far as
possible from the vertex with the external gauge multiplet. After
these manipulations the diagrams can be represented pictorially as  
\begin{equation}
\raisebox{-2.5ex}{\includegraphics[height=1.2cm,keepaspectratio]{diag_2loop3.ps}}
\quad + \quad 
\raisebox{-2.5ex}{\includegraphics[height=1.2cm,keepaspectratio]{diag_2loop4.ps}}
~.
\label{eq26}
\end{equation} 
After some straightforward algebra involving $\overline{D}{}^2$ and 
$D^2$ along the chiral field propagators, one can show that 
the ordinary chiral line in the first diagram of (\ref{eq26}) 
can be reduced to a trivial delta
function in the superspace.
%by partially integrating a $\overline{D}{}^2$ to
%this propagator and using that 
%$\overline{D}{}^2 D^2 \overline{D}{}^2 = 16\, \Box\, \overline{D}{}^2$ 
(%any derivatives acting on $V$ are irrelevant since they are total
%derivatives in superspace). 
%Partial integration of the
%$\overline{D}{}^2$ back after these operations shows that 
This makes both diagrams in (\ref{eq26}) identical in structure, and of opposite signs. 
Thus, we observe that these diagrams indeed cancel, and no FI $D$ terms arises even 
at two (or higher) loop order.  


It is well known that anomalies put severe restrictions of the matter
spectrum of particle physics models. One may wonder whether Lorentz
violation might lead to new anomalies. If so either the Lorentz
violating vectors are restricted by stringent conditions that ensure the
anomaly cancellation, or gauge non-invariant terms would have to be
included to the classical action in order to cancel the gauge variation of the
effective action with the fermions integrated out. In the
SUSY LV context the supersymmetric extension
of the Chern-Simons term would be a possible term that could cancel new
anomalies. We will show now that LV terms at dimension five
do not modify the chiral anomaly. As a consequence, there are no
further restrictions on the Lorentz violating vectors and the 
local gauge non-invariant supersymmetric
Chern-Simons term is not admissible. 


To prove the claim that there are no new gauge anomalies we 
closely follow the computation of the covariant anomaly presented in 
refs.\ \cite{Hayashi:1998ca,Gates:2000gu} using the techniques developed by 
Fujikawa and Konishi \cite{Fujikawa:1983bg,Konishi:1985tu}. We consider the
Lorentz violating classical chiral multiplet action 
\begin{equation}
S = \int d^8z\, \overline{\Phi} 
e^V \Big(1 + i N^\mu \nabla_\mu  \Big) \Phi~, 
\end{equation}
with the gauge covariant super derivatives 
$\nabla_\mu = - \frac i4 \bar\sigma^{\alpha\dot\alpha}_\mu 
\{ \nabla_\alpha, \overline{\nabla}_{\dot\alpha} \}$, 
$\overline{\nabla}_{\dot\alpha} = \overline{D}_{\dot\alpha}$ and 
$ \nabla_\alpha = e^{-V}D_\alpha e^V$. The variation of the effective
action obtained by integrating out the chiral multiplet $\Phi$ under a
chiral gauge transformation 
($\delta \Lambda \neq 0, \delta \overline{\Lambda} = 0$)
is given by 
\begin{equation}
\delta_\Lambda\Gamma(V) ~=~ 
\langle \delta_\Lambda S \rangle = 
\Big\langle \int d^8z\,  \overline{\Phi} 
e^V \Big(1 + i N^\mu \nabla_\mu  \Big) (\delta \Lambda\, \Phi)
\Big\rangle~.
\label{vareffact}
\end{equation} 
This expression is regularizated by inserting the operator 
$\exp (\Box_+/M^2)$, where $\Box_+$ is the covariant d'Alembertian that
preserves chirality, and $M$ is the regulator mass which will be taken
to $M \rightarrow \infty$ at the end of the computation. To
evaluate the regularized amplitude we determine the propagator in the
background field $V$: 
\begin{equation}
\langle \Phi_2 \overline{\Phi}_1 e^V_1 \rangle = 
i \Big(   
1 + i N^\mu \frac 1{16 \Box_+} \overline{\nabla}{}^2 \nabla{}^2
\nabla_\mu
\Big)^{-1}_2 
\Big( 
\frac 1{16 \Box_+} \overline{\nabla}{}^2 \nabla{}^2
\Big)_2 \delta^8_{21}~.
\end{equation}
Here the subscripts $1$ and $2$ indicate that the corresponding
expression is a function (or derivative) of the superspace coordinates
$z_1$ and $z_2$. By inserting this propagator in the variation of the
effective action \eqref{vareffact}, one can show that the LV
factors exactly cancel out, and the anomaly reduces to the standard
one without any Lorentz violation. Notice that in this derivation we
have not used any properties of the operator $i N^\mu \nabla_\mu$
except that it is gauge covariant, therefore this line of arguments
shows that any kinetic modification will not lead to new anomaly
constraints. 





\subsection{RGE evolution of dimension five LV operators in SQED}
\label{RGEvolution}




As mentioned in the Introduction, within the effective field theory approach, 
we are allowed to assume that operators (\ref{LV_matter}), 
(\ref{LV_gauge}) and (\ref{LV_gauge_Tterm})  
are generated at the UV scale $M$ by some unspecified LV dynamics. 
However, all experimental limits are obtained at much lower energy
scales. Therefore, in order to derive meaningful experimental
constraints on parameters of LV SQED, we have to evolve the LV
operators down to the low-energy scale. Furthermore, we know that
supersymmetry is broken, and the operators of dimension five will
source  the dimension three LV operators via supersymmetry
breaking, leading to tight bounds on LV parameters of the model.
In this section we find and solve the renormalization group equations     
for dimension 5 LV operators assuming unbroken SUSY. In the next
section we include the effects of soft breaking and calculate resulting dimension
three operators. 


We work in the linear approximation in LV parameters, and
neglect all terms that involve higher powers of $1/M$.
The running of the LV operators (\ref{LV_matter}), (\ref{LV_gauge})
and (\ref{LV_gauge_Tterm}) is, in part, a consequence of the wave
function renormalization of various superfields induced by
standard SQED one-loop diagrams. We do not give them explicitly here,
but we take their effects into account in the resulting RGE's. 
For the logarithmic running of the LV parameters above the supersymmetric threshold,
we can ignore soft breaking masses and electron mass inside the loops.  
At one loop, it means that loop diagrams with internal lines of $\Phi_+$ and $\Phi_-$
can be calculated independently.


%Though we do
%keep in mind the exact cancellation \eqref{ResummedPropVer} 
%and focus on the remaining diagrams only. 

The renormalization of the electron/positron LV operators
\eqref{LV_matter} is induced by the diagrams shown in 
Fig.~\ref{diag_LV_chiral}:

        (\ref{LV_matter}), (\ref{LV_gauge}).
}
\end{figure}

The first two diagrams involve the interactions
\eqref{LV_matter_int2}. Notice that the seagull diagram vanishes
because photon superfield loop contains only two super covariant derivatives. 
The last diagram is induced only by
\eqref{LV_gauge}, and the loops with the single insertion of tensor interaction
\eqref{LV_gauge_Tterm} vanish identically, as there are no 
operators in the chiral sector that can couple to $T^{\mu\nu\lambda}$. 


In the gauge sector we find that the renormalization of the tensor LV
gauge operator \eqref{LV_gauge_Tterm} is absent. 
Indeed, since we work in the first order in
LV, this operator cannot receive any corrections from operators that
depend on vector backgrounds. The renormalization of LV
gauge operator with $N^\mu$ \eqref{LV_gauge} is given by the diagrams shown in
Fig.~\ref{diag_LV_gauge},

\end{figure}
Again, one can use the cancellation property (\ref{ResummedPropVer}) 
to observe that the vertex in the second diagram of Figure 2 is given by \eqref{LV_matter_int2} only. 
The combination of these gauge self-energy diagrams is
only logarithmically divergent, and thus the dimension three LV Chern-Simons
term is not generated by these loops in this approximation.  

After a straightforward calculation of logarithmically divergent parts of diagrams in
Fugres ~\ref{diag_LV_chiral} and \ref{diag_LV_gauge}, upon the inclusion of 
the wave function renormalization,
we arrive at the renormalization group equation (RGE) for the LV parameters:

As usual, $\alpha = e^2/(4\pi)$ denotes the fine structure coefficient. 
The (1,1) and (4,4) elements of the matrix in
(\ref{RG_eqn_undiag}) are equal and trivial, resulting only from the renormalization of 
wave functions. The electron and the
positron LV parameters $N_\pm^\mu$ both give and receive equal
contributions to and from the vector LV parameter $N^\mu$, or in other words 
matrix elements (1,2) and (1,3), (2,2) and (3,3), and (2,1) and (3,1) are equal. 

It will prove useful to introduce the following combinations of 
LV parameters that couple to operators of definite parity:
%%
%% definition of N_V, N_A
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{def_Nmu}
\nonumber
      N^\mu_V & = & \frac{ N_+^\mu ~-~ N_-^\mu }{2}~~  
	\\
      N^\mu_A & = & \frac{ N_+^\mu ~+~ N_-^\mu }{2}~~.
\end{eqnarray}
$N^\mu_V$ is the charge conjugation odd, and $N^\mu_A$ is the 
charge conjugation even combination. 

In genral, the vector backgrounds do not need to have  the same orientation in the
4D space, and the off-diagonal elements of the renormalization group coefficients 
in (\ref{RG_eqn_undiag}) mix them, resulting in the change of their direction. 
Therefore by diagonalizing \eqref{RG_eqn_undiag} we identify the set of eigenvectors 
\begin{equation*}
N_1^\mu = N^\mu_V
\qquad 
N_2^\mu = 3 N^\mu - 2 N^\mu_A~,
\qquad 
N_3^\mu = 2 N^\mu + N^\mu_A~,
\end{equation*} 
%\begin{equation*}
%N_1^\mu = N_+^\mu - N_-^\mu~, 
%\qquad 
%N_2^\mu = 3 N^\mu - N_+^\mu - N_-^\mu~, 
%\qquad 
%N_2^\mu = 4 N^\mu + N_+^\mu + N_-^\mu~, 
%\end{equation*} 
that evolve under the RGE independently, 
changing their size but not the direction. The fact that
$N_1^\mu$ renormalizes independently can be understood by noting 
that it is the only combination that is odd under the charge conjugation.
In this basis, the RGE's and their solutions are given by 
\begin{equation} 
\mu \frac{\partial}{\partial\mu} \, N_i^\nu 
~=~ \lambda_i\, \frac { \alpha}{2 \pi} \, N_i^\nu~ 
\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad 
N_i^\nu(\mu) ~=~ 
\Big(  \frac {\alpha(\mu)}{\alpha(M)} \Big)^{\frac {\lambda_i}2} \, 
N_i^\nu(M)~, 
\label{LV_at_soft_scale}
\end{equation} 
where the eigenvalues read 
$\lambda_i = (\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3) = (3, 6, -1)$. 
To obtain the solutions we have used the standard SQED beta function  
\( 
\mu \frac{\partial}{\partial\mu} \, \alpha = \frac 1{\pi} \,
\alpha^2.  
\) 


Within the SQED framework, the renormalization effects 
on these LV parameters are small: 
even if we take $\mu = m_{s} \approx 1$ TeV and 
$M = M_P \approx 10^{19}$ GeV the running affects the LV parameters by
about 10\%. In other words, the linearized version of (\ref{LV_at_soft_scale}) 
\begin{equation}
N_i^\nu(m_s) \simeq \left(1- \frac{\lambda_i\alpha}{2\pi}\ln(M/m_s)\right)N_i^\nu(M)
\label{simplified}
\end{equation}
gives a good approximation to exact answer. 
The same conclusion holds for the running of the
irreducible tensor $T^{\lambda\, \mu\nu}$. 
%Since we do not know the
%size of these LV parameters and simply assume that they are of order
It may appear that a  10 percent level change in $N_i^\mu$ is
insignificant, however, we should keep in mind that in a 
realistic framework of MSSM the number of charged degrees of 
freedom running inside the loops is significantly larger than in SQED, 
which would lead to appreciable changes in LV parameters 
between the Planck and the weak scales.  
%For this reason we may simply give order one values for
%these LV parameters $N^\mu, N_\pm^\mu$ and $T^{\lambda\, \mu\nu}$ at
%the soft breaking scale $m_{s}$. 
However, the main numerical change in the actual size of the observable 
LV effects will result from the soft SUSY breaking, as it will be shown in the next
sections.

\section{Induced operators of dimension 3}
\label{InducedDim3}

Once the SUSY is broken, dimension 3 LV operators can be induced 
with coefficients controlled by the soft-breaking mass scale. 
%Now that we have reached the scale $ m_{s} $, we 
%need to take SUSY breaking into account. 
Following a usual approach (see {\em e.g.} Ref. \cite{Wess:1992cp})
we introduce a spurion singlet
chiral superfield $ S $ which interacts with the SQED
multiplets and provides masses for the scalar particles
in the matter sector. We could consider other  
    soft-breaking terms including a gaugino mass, but in this paper we restrict
ourselves to the limit  $ m_{selectron} \gg m_{photino}$ which often holds in 
benchmark MSSM scenarios.
Generically, we can assume that parity is broken, so that
the scalar partners of left- and right-handed electrons have different masses.
To do this, we introduce two different
spurion superfields $ S_+ $ and $ S_- $
for the selectron and spositron correspondingly.
The spurions give masses to the electron and positron
via the higher dimensional interaction
%%
%% SB vertex
\begin{equation}
\label{SB_vertex}
  \mathcal{L}_{SB} = - \frac{1}{M^2} \int d^4\theta \, 
\left[\overline{S}_+ S_+ \overline{\Phi}_+ \Phi_+ 
~+~
\overline{S}_- S_- \overline{\Phi}_- \Phi_-
\right] 
~.
\end{equation}
Some hidden dynamical mechanisms are assumed to be responsible 
    for  $ S_\pm $ developing a 
nonzero vacuum expectation values for their $ F $-components:
\[
\left | \langle F^\pm_S \rangle \right | =
M^2 {m^\pm_{s}}^2~,\qquad 
\langle\phi_S^\pm\rangle = 
\langle\psi_S^\pm\rangle = 0~.
\]
%Note that for expression (\ref{SB_vertex}) to be 
%gauge-invariant one would have to introduce extra factors
%of $ e^{2eV} $. 
%However, provided that $ S_\pm $ condenses to 
%$ \theta^2 \langle F^\pm_S \rangle $,
%in the Wess-Zumino gauge we can take $e^{2eV}=1$.
	To manifest parity violation in SUSY breaking, we introduce 
%%
%% Definition of Delta m^2
\begin{equation}
\Delta m^2 = \frac{ {m_{s}^+}^2 ~ - ~ {m_{s}^-}^2 }
  {                  2                  }~~;
\qquad
{m_{s}^\pm}^2 = m_s^2 ~\pm~ \frac{\Delta m^2}{2}~.
\label{deltam}
\end{equation}
	Parity-conserving scenario is then simply the limit
	$ \Delta m^2 \to 0 $. Throughout the paper we assume that 
	$m_s^2>\Delta m^2$. 
Once SUSY is broken via (\ref{SB_vertex}) in the Lorentz-conserving sector, 
%combined with a dimension 5 LV operator,
%generates dimension 3 LV terms in the fermion matter sector at one loop level or 
% in selectron sector upon the use 
 %   of the equations of motion. 
%Presence of such terms must be carefully investigated, 
%because  they can easily dominate over dimension 5 operators
%in observable effects.
it can be communicated in the LV sector via quantum loops or on the equations of motion, resulting 
in the LV operators of dimension three. 

We start with some general remarks about dimension LV 3 operators 
that one can expect to appear. We can easily list all such operators in 
the component form,essentially extending the existing QED parametrization \cite{Kost1} 
to the SQED field content. In the matter sector these operators are
\begin{eqnarray}
% first line
%\nonumber
{\cal L}_{\rm LV ~ ~dim~3}^{\rm matter} = 
&& 2\;i\, \widetilde{A}_+^\mu\, \overline{z}_+ 
\mathcal{D}_\mu z_+ 2\;i\, \widetilde{A}_-^\mu\, \overline{z}_-
\mathcal{D}_\mu z_- 
% second line
\label{LV_dim3_comp}
+\widetilde{B}_+^\mu\, \overline{\psi}_+\overline{\sigma}_\mu \psi_+ 
+ \widetilde{B}_-^\mu\, \overline{\psi}_-\overline{\sigma}_\mu \psi_-\\
% third line
\nonumber
&& +i\, \widetilde{C}^\mu\, z_- \mathcal{D}_\mu z_+ 
 +\widetilde{D}^{\mu\nu}\, \psi_- \sigma_{\mu\nu} 
     \psi_+~.
\end{eqnarray}
In superfield notation they can be re-written as:
%%
%% General dimension 3 LV operators in ``supersymmetric'' notation
\begin{eqnarray}
% first 
{\cal L}_{\rm LV ~ ~dim~3}^{\rm matter} = \int d^4\theta~ \theta^4\left[
2i  \widetilde{A}_+^\mu\, 
\overline{\Phi}_+ \nabla^+_\mu \Phi_+
-
2i \widetilde{A}_-^\mu\, \Phi_- 
                        \nabla^-_\mu 
    \overline{\Phi}_-  \right.\nonumber\\
% second

\left.
\frac{1}{2}
\widetilde{B}_+^\mu\,

\overline{\nabla}\, \overline{\Phi}_- \overline{\sigma}_\mu \nabla \Phi_- +
\widetilde{C}^\mu
\Phi_- \nabla_\mu^+ \Phi_+ +\theta^4\, \widetilde{D}^{\mu\nu}\,
\nabla \Phi_- \sigma_{\mu\nu} \nabla \Phi_+\right], 
\end{eqnarray}
with $\theta^4 = \theta^2 \bar\theta^2$.

It is quite obvious that the operators $ \widetilde{C}^\mu $
and $ \widetilde{D}^{\mu\nu} $ in (\ref{LV_dim3_comp}) cannot
be generated from dimension 5 LV supersymmetric operators 
by inclusion of the supersymmetry breaking (\ref{SB_vertex}). 
%It turns out that at tree level there are no suitable dimension 5 operators
%that would generate them on the equations of motion 
%(see Appendix~\ref{app_reduction}). 
These operators require a chirality flip, $\Phi_+\leftrightarrow \Phi_-$, 
and thus can be sourced  only by the SUSY LV operators of dimension 6 or higher.
%Thus, they could possibly arise at loops. 
%But then, the handedness flip (i.e. $ z_+ \to z_- $) requires
%at least one power of quark mass, and SB yields another two
%powers of $ m_{s} $.
%Therefore we get the total of 3 powers of mass decrease, which
%cannot happen in a dimension 5 $ \to $ dimension 3 reduction.
%Another observation is that in reality, i.e. in (MS)SM, 
%SU(2) gauge symmetry would require a Higgs
%field, which will raise the dimension of the mentioned operators.

Superfield expression (\ref{LV_dim3}) for operators (\ref{LV_dim3_comp}) is not unique.
Alternatively, one can obtain 
all SUSY breaking LV operators in the superfield form by
inserting  $ \theta^2 $, 
$ \bar{\theta}^2 $, 
$ \theta_\alpha \bar{\theta}_{\dot\alpha},... $ inside the 
gauge-invariant supersymmetric LV operators \cite{GrootNibbelink:2004za}.
%In particular, one way of doing this 
%\cite{GrootNibbelink:2004za}
%is to introduce a spurion vector superfield
%%
%% spurion vector superfield
%\[
%\widetilde{V} = -\, \widetilde{v}^\mu \cdot 
%\theta \sigma_\mu \bar{\theta}~,
%\]
%which is effectively an insertion of 
%$ \theta_\alpha \bar{\theta}_{\dot\alpha} $.
%But it turns out that upon the use of identities

However, upon the use of identities $\theta^2 =  \overline{D}^2 ( \theta^2 \bar{\theta}^2 );~

%D^2 \overline{D}^2 ( \theta^2 \bar{\theta}^2 ) \\
%         & \ldots\ldots &
%\end{eqnarray*}
%and integration by part, possible operators with insertion of $\widetilde V$ can 
%be re-written as a linear combination 
% of operators (\ref{LV_dim3}).
one can show that all alternative representation of (\ref{LV_dim3_comp})
can be re-written as linear combinations of (\ref{LV_dim3}).

In the gauge sector, in WZ gauge the only LV dimension 3 
operators are:
%%
%% Gauge dimension 3 operators in components
\begin{eqnarray}
{\cal L}_{\rm LV ~ ~dim~3}^{\rm gauge} =
\widetilde{E}_\mu\, \epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}

\widetilde{F}_\mu\, \lambda \sigma^\mu \overline{\lambda} 
~,

+
\overline{D}_{\dot\alpha}V\,

\,
\right\}\right].
\end{eqnarray*}

\subsection{Operators in the matter sector}

We now turn to the discussion of possible mechanisms that turn dimension 5 SUSY LV operators
 to dimension 3 LV operators. We notice that there are two generic ways this 
may occur, at tree level and via loop effects, 
%% mechanisms of dim 5 -> dim 3 reduction
\begin{eqnarray*}
% first
%\nonumber 
%O^{(5)} & \stackrel{\mathrm {EOM}}{\longrightarrow} &
%  m_e^2\, O^{(3)} \\
% second
\nonumber
O^{(5)} & \stackrel{\mathrm {EOM}}{\longrightarrow} &
  (m_{s}^2 + m_e^2)\, O^{(3)}~~~{\rm for~selectrons}\\
% third
\nonumber
O^{(5)} & \stackrel{\mathrm {1\ loop}}{\longrightarrow} &
  m_{s}^2\, O^{(3)} ~~~{\rm for~fermions ~and ~bosons}
~.
\end{eqnarray*}
	We notice that tensor operator (\ref{LV_gauge_Tterm}) does not
	mix with dimension 3 operators in any order in SUSY breaking, because there
	is no dimension 3 operator that can couple to $T^{\mu\nu\lambda}$.
Soft supersymmetry
breaking in the form (\ref{SB_vertex}) will affect the
LV interactions for left- and right-handed selectrons already at tree level.
The  masses of scalar particle are lifted with
respect to the masses of the electron and positron. 
This alters sfermions equations of motion, leading to the 
{\em enhancement} of certain dimension 3 operators. Ignoring 
the $\Delta m^2$ for a moment, one can easily show that the 
combination of LV operators (\ref{LV_matter}) and 
SUSY breaking (\ref{SB_vertex}) leads to the 
following dimension 3 LV operator,
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_{\rm sparticle}^{\rm EOM} = 
\frac{N_V^\mu}{M}\, 2 i\, 
\left(
m_e^2 + m_s^2
\right)
\Bigl\{ 
\overline{z}_+ \mathcal{D}_\mu z_+ 
~-~
\overline{z}_- \mathcal{D}_\mu z_- 
\Bigr\}
\end{equation}
effectively  generating the $ \widetilde{A}^\mu_\pm $-terms (\ref{LV_dim3_comp}),
 \begin{equation}
\widetilde{A}_\pm^\mu = 
\pm\, 2\, \frac{N_V^\mu}
                        { M }   
\left\{
m_e^2 ~+~ m_s^2
\right\}~.
\end{equation}
However, we will not be interested in these particular operators 
due to current impossibility to study experimentally  the superpartner sector. 
In the matter sector only the operators involving electrons and positrons are 
of a particular value for phenomenology.  
For the same reason, in the gauge sector we will only be interested
in the Chern-Simons term that might be induced for photons.

At one-loop level, the transmission 
of SUSY breaking to the LV sector of chiral fermions and gauge bosons may indeed
be possible. We start with the 1-loop effects in the matter sector.
%	To consider 1-loop effects in presence of the soft SUSY-breaking terms, 
%	we essentially need to repeat the RG analysis which we performed in
%	section \ref{RGEvolution}.
%	Now, formally speaking, the propagators must become massive, yet with a SUSY-breaking
%	mass. 
%	If loop momenta are small, $|p_{loop}| \sim m_{s}$, which corresponds to the 
%	threshold corrections,
% 	the soft mass has to be taken into account exactly, to all orders.
It is sufficient for our purposes to consider the running of dimension 3 operators 
withing the interval of momenta $ m_{s} \ll |p_{loop}|\ll M $, and retain only 
the contributions enhanced by large parameter, $\log(M/m_{s})$,
neglecting possible threshold corrections.
To this accuracy, 
	the soft breaking parameters inside loops can be treated as perturbations
	and inserted explicitly in the internal lines of diagrams from Fig.~\ref{diag_LV_chiral}.
% M.P.
%        All radiative corrections involving superpartners
%        can be divided roughly into two categories. 
%	The first is the logarithmic running 
%        of the soft-breaking operators and Kahler terms for which the interval of the loop momenta 
%        is $m_{s} \ll |p_{loop}|\ll M$. In this case, the soft breaking parameters 
%	inside the loops
%        can be treated as perturbations, and inserted explicitly in the lines. 
%        The second category corresponds to 
%        $|p_{loop}| \sim m_{s}$, where the insertion approximation breaks down 
%	and the $m_{s}$
%        has to be taken into account exactly. 
%	These are the corrections from the sparticle threshold. 
%        We concentrate on the first category, as it is enhanced relative to the threshold 
%	corrections by a 
%        large logarithm, $\log(M/m_{s})$. 
%            Thus, we have to consider all diagrams with two external chiral fields
%        containing one LV insertion and one SUSY-breaking (SB) insertion
%        in all possible ways. 
%        That is achieved by inserting a  SUSY-breaking interaction in all diagrams of Figs

%         Fig.~\ref{diag_LV_chiral} that cannot be complemented by soft-breaking insertion
%        so as to stay one-particle-irreducible. 
%        This way we find that the only diagram that trasmits LV from the gauge sector to 
%        dimension 3 operators in the electron sector is the diagram shown in 
	For the contribution coming from the LV in the gauge sector (the last diagram
	in Fig.~\ref{diag_LV_chiral}), this results in only one diagram shown in
        Fig.~\ref{diag_SB_chiral_gauge_LV}.

\label{SB_gauge_sector}
    
    The absence of optical activity effects caused by the Chern-Simons (CS) term 
    has been checked over the cosmological distances, providing a 
    very sensitive probe of $k_\mu$ in (\ref{LVqed}) 
(see {\em e.g.} Ref. \cite{CFJ} and references therein). 
   The limit on $k_\mu$ is about the prsent Hubble expansion rate, and is ten orders of magnitude 
    better than the level of sensitivity for the best terrestrial experiments searching for 
    LV parameters in (\ref{LVqed}). Not surprisingly, the issue of 
CS term generated by radiative corrections from other LV interactions 
    has drawn a lot of interest \cite{CG,Jackiw:1999yp,Chung:1998jv,Andrianov:2001zj}, 
    exhibiting the whole range of answers for $k_\mu$ being induced by $b_\mu$ (including zero).
    In LV SQED, the no-go theorem by Coleman an Glashow \cite{CG} indicates
    the absence of the radiatively-denerated Chern-Simons term. If suitably rephrased, it states that
    the Chern-Simons term cannot be induced to first order in gauge-invariant
    LV interactions. Clearly, whether in the broken or in the SUSY phase, our theory can be written totally
    in component fields, thus representing an abelian field theory with a number of nontrivial
    Lorentz-violating and Lorentz-preserving interactions.
    Hence we expect this theorem to hold in our case. 
    We check this explicitly by analyzing cancellations of contributions
    of certain groups of diagrams potentially leading to a CS term. 

	We find that dimension 5 LV terms in SQED do not lead to the CS term at one loop level,
	and this statement holds even if supersymmetry is softly broken.
%From the beginning of this section we know that in the observable
%sector the only possible operator is Chern-Simons.
%Hence our goal is to find out whether Chern-Simons can
%be induced by dimension 5 operators via SUSY breaking at one 
 Note that this statement is only valid for the pure Chern-Simons term
$ \epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\, A_\nu \partial_\rho A_\sigma $, 
while there is no evidence against another possible operator in the 
    photon sector,  $ \lambda \sigma^\mu \overline{\lambda} $,
    that corresponds to a gauge-invariant Lagrange density, rather than just a 
    gauge-invariant action. The presence/absence of the latter term is not very relevant for
phenomenological applications due to the obvious reasons. 

A generic argument against the possibility to induce the CS term
    is based on the gauge invariance of  LV terms (\ref{LV_matter})
versus only  a "partial" gauge invariance, up to a total derivative, of the 
    CS term in (\ref{CSint}).
%The idea is that the terms (\ref{LV_matter}) are 
%{\it exactly} gauge invariant, whereas any ``supersymmetric''
%notation for Chern-Simons will be gauge invariant only
%up to a total derivative (just because Chern-Simons itself
%is such).
This difference become very serious if in (\ref{LV_matter})
we allow $ N_+^\mu $ to represent a field or at least a slow-varying function
of space-time.  This will keep the gauge invariant property of 
    operator (\ref{LV_matter}) and hence of all diagrams with its insertion,
while the $ N_+^\mu $-induced Chern-Simons will loose gauge invariance completely.
Therefore, the most reasonable possibility is to have {\em no connection} between 
the CS term and operators  (\ref{LV_matter}). A usual worry is that 
the UV regularization may invalidate a no-go theorem \cite{CG}, and thus generating 
    a CS term at the UV scale. This possibility, however, 
is excluded by our assumption of the supersymmetric dynamics at the UV scale, and the 
explicit breaking of SUSY by the CS term \cite{Belich:,GrootNibbelink:2004za}.

First we checked  all possible diagrams with the chiral loop and two 
  external gauge supefields in exact SUSY, retaining a non-zero value of $m_e$. 
%This differs from the previous case in that
%fermions here now also have a mass (although, small).
It is quite easy to show that for such diagrams the only possible operator 
which may contain the CS term when expressed in terms
of the vector superfield $ V $ is
%%
%% Typical Chern-Simons-containing term, in superfields
\begin{equation}
\label{LV_CS}
\int d^4\theta \, V \overline{D}\, \overline{\slashed{N}}_+ D\, V~~.
\end{equation}
        It is then sufficient to check for presence/absence of (\ref{LV_CS})-proportional
contributions in the diagrams of Fig.~\ref{diag_gauge_massive}.
	For generality, we have considered massive SQED with a complex mass parameter.

As before, the diagrams with $ N_-^\mu $
are obtained by flipping all the charges in diagrams for $ N_+^\mu $.
  %      An attentive look reveals that this won't in fact change 
%anything: 
%the diagrams proportional to the square of the same charge
%do not depend on the sign of the charge, 
%while those proportional to the different charges will
%just have them switched.
%So, again, the result for 
%$ n_{\bar{e}}^\mu $
%is the same as for
%$ n_e^\mu $
%(except that it is proportional to the positron background).
An explicit calculation reveals that all contributions of the type
(\ref{LV_CS}) cancel for both $N^\mu_+$ and $N^\mu_-$ backgrounds. 
We conclude now that Chern-Simons is not generated at one loop
in {\it massive exact SQED with a complex mass}.


We expect that nothing will change even if supersymmetry is broken, at least at one loop level.
    Indeed, the CS term can only be generated by a fermion running in
the loop, as a bosonic loop cannot produce 
$ \epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} $ entering the expression for CS.
However, the SUSY breaking terms (\ref{SB_vertex}) only 
provide a mass to the bosonic component of chiral superfields
and thus only affect the parts of the diagrams that are not 
capable of inducing the CS in the first place. 
%Thus the fermion does not ``participate'' in SUSY breaking,%
%and the required $ \epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} $ 
%will not arise.

    This argument can be solidified by a direct calculation in the presence of the soft-breaking.
The relevant diagrams are obtained by inserting
the soft breaking vertex 
$ \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{SB}} $ (\ref{SB_vertex}) into 
the diagrams shown in Fig.~\ref{diag_LV_gauge}.
This yields the set of graphs represented in 
Fig.~\ref{diag_SB_gauge}.

Again, instead of calculating every possible term, including the threshold corrections 
to dimension 5 operators, we only concentrate on one structure 
%%
%% Typical SB term containing Chern-Simons in components
\begin{equation}
\label{SB_ChernSimons}
|F_S|^2 \int dx ~ \mathrm{tr} \,\left\{\, 
      \slashed{v} \, \overline{\slashed{\partial}} \,
      \slashed{N} \, \overline{\slashed{v}} \,
                              \right\}
~~,
\end{equation}
where $ v_\mu $ is the photon, and $ tr $ means
taking the trace of the product of Pauli 
$ \sigma $-matrices.
Here, again, the vertex cancellation property
can be used quite effectively to mutually cancel 
contributions of particular diagrams.
A straightforward calculation shows that indeed,
as anticipated, all (\ref{SB_ChernSimons})-proportional terms cancel.

%We therefore conclude that in the 
%{\it massless SQED with soft SUSY breaking}
%dimension 5 Lorentz-violating operators do not
%induce Chern-Simons at one loop. 
%Obviously, that 
%{\it so more cannot happen in massive SQED},
%since by introducing mass into diagrams in 
%Fig.~\ref{diag_SB_gauge}
%we would reduce
%the dimension 5 operators to dimension 2.
%{\bf Do we leave this statement? Compare to the
%  last paragraph in Section~\ref{Massive_SUSY}.}


%However, we can now again use the conjecture made
%in Section~\ref{SB_gauge_sector}: for a Chern-Simons to be
%generated, one needs fermions running in the loop. 
%Obviously, there {\it are} fermions running in the loops
%of diagrams in 
%Fig.~\ref{diag_gauge_massive}, 
%but they don't lead to a Chern-Simons term.
%If we now softly break supersymmetry by adding a mass
%to the selectron/spositron like we did before, 
%we will change nothing for fermions.
We conclude that  the Chern-Simons term is not induced
by dimension 5 LV operators in SQED, which leaves us a task of 
    using other constraints that \cite{CFJ} to limit the LV parameters of the model.
{\bf What does the last sentence mean, didn't quite get it?}

\section{Phenomenology of LV SQED: LV observables and experimental limits}
\label{Phenomenology}
\subsection{Component Expressions for LV operators}

%As mentioned earlier, besides supersymmetry breaking, 
%dimension 3 operators can be induced by dimension 5 LV 
%operators via the equations of motion.
%Dimension 5 operators will turn into dimension 3 operators 
%with a factor of the mass dimension two.
%This factor depends on the particular operator of consideration.
%Some of them (e.g. those involving fermions) 
%get multiplied by $ m_e^2 $ on the equations of motion.
%Those involving scalars get a factor of
%$ m_e^2 + m_s^2 $
%due to the supersymmetry breaking (\ref{SB_vertex}).
%Others are multiplied by the electromagnetic fieldstrength.

%At the scale below $ m_{s} $, we have the dimension 5 LV
%operators (\ref{LV_matter}), (\ref{LV_gauge}) and 
%(\ref{LV_gauge_Tterm}) evaluated at this scale.
%There are also dimension 3 operators 
%induced by supersymmetry breaking which were derived
%in section \ref{InducedDim3}. 

In order to derive phenomenological consequences of the LV operators, 
we need their expressions explicitly in component fields. 
First we consider the matter operators (\ref{LV_matter}).
The component form for the electron part is given by:

Component representation  of dimension 5 LV 
operators allows further reduction of several terms in (\ref{LV_electron_comp})
on the equations of motion.
%First, we resolve the equations of motion of the auxiliary
%fields $ D $, $ F_\pm $. 
%Then we resolve the unperturbed equations of motion for the
%fields: this allows us to replace the 2nd derivative of
%the scalar fields and the derivative of the fermion fields
%by the RHS of the corresponding equations of motion.
The result for this tedious but routine reduction
is given in Appendix~\ref{app_reduction}.
To facilitate phenomenological applications, we convert
all Weyl spinors into Dirac/Majorana four-spinors:

\end{equation}
      Using notations (\ref{def_Nmu}), (\ref{deltam}), we present the result for dimension 5 
%% In these notations the resulting operators in the 
LV operators (\ref{LV_matter}), containing electron and photon fields:

axial-vector operators:

\end{eqnarray}




The next operator to consider is the photon operator
(\ref{LV_gauge}):

~.
\end{eqnarray}
These components are reducible on the equations of motion, 
and only the last term in (\ref{LV_gauge_comp_again})
leads to contribution in the sector of electrons and photons. 
Substituting $ \partial_\lambda F^{\lambda\mu} $ 
with the electromagnetic current 
$ J_{EM}^\mu=- e\, \overline{\Psi}\, \gamma^\mu \Psi $,
we get an interaction term
%%                                             __
%% Observable operator induced on EOM from the WnW

\widetilde{F}_{\mu\nu}\, \Psi~,
\end{equation}
which  has the same form as the second term in (\ref{resolved_LV_Dirac}).
Notice, however, that this coincidence holds only within QED, 
as in the full theory $J_{EM}^\mu$ will also have other 
({\em i.e.} hadronic) contributions. 

Finally, the tensor operator (\ref{LV_gauge_Tterm}) has the following component 
expression,

upon the use of integration by part and Jacobi identities.

electromagnetic field stength in the square brackets of 
(\ref{LV_gauge_Tterm_comp_again}), we obtain in the

\subsection{Constraints on LV parameters of SQED}

Now, we are prepared to extract observational consequences of LV SQED,
and impose constraints on the
coefficients of the effective low-energy lagrangian
(\ref{L_eff}). To do that, we derive the non-relativistic
effective Hamiltonian corresponding to (\ref{L_eff}),
splitting external backgrounds into spatial and  time-like components,

	\biggr\}~,
\end{eqnarray}
	where $ \vec{p} = - i \hbar \vec{\partial} $ is the momentum operator and $\{.,.\}$
	stands for the anticommutator. 

The operator $ a^\mu $ does not to lead to
any physical effects as it can be totally absorbed into
the kinetic term 
$ - i\, \overline{\Psi}\slashed{\partial}\Psi $
via a trivial phase redifinition, $ \Psi(x) \to e^{i a^\mu x_\mu} \Psi(x) $.
The rest of the operators leads to the observable LV signatures. 

The tightest constraints come from the experiments searching for the 
abnormal spin precession around the external directions given by the
LV vectors (\ref{L_eff_coefs}). These experiments limit LV parameters 
for electrons and nucleons. The relevant parameter we should compare 
our estimates with is $\Delta \omega_{LV}$, the energy shift due to 
LV effects. In LV SQED, the effects are mediated by dimension 
five operators, and therefore the strength of the constraints on 
combinations of $M$ and LV backgrounds depends very sensitively on the 
energy scale $\mu$ relating $\Delta \omega_{LV}$ and $M^{-1}$, 
$\Delta \omega_{LV} \sim \mu^2 M^{-1}$. Our analysis shows that 
several possibilities for $\mu$ are possible: the soft breaking scale, 
the hadronic scale, $\mu \sim \Lambda_{QCD}$, electron mass, and 
finally the energy scale given by external magnetic or electric field. 

The soft  breaking scale enter in the LV parameter $b_\mu$, which is 
limited by  experiments searching for LV in the electron sector 
\cite{Heckel:1999sy}. The sensitivity to the spatial part of the axial-vector 
coupling $b^i$ achieved in this experiments is at the level better than $10^{-28}$GeV. 
This imposes a stringent constrain on the combination of the soft breaking masses,
$M$, and LV parameters:
\begin{equation}
|b^i|<10^{-28}~{\rm GeV}
\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad
\frac{m_{s}^2M_{19}^{-1}}{(100~{\rm GeV})^2}
\left| N_A^i - \frac{3}{2} N^i + \delta_{s} N_V^i \right |< 10^{-12},
\label{b_limit}
\end{equation}
where we have normalized $M$ on $10^{19}$ GeV, $M_{19}\equiv 10^{19}~{\rm GeV}/M$, and introduced 
a dimensionless parameter $\delta = \Delta m^2/(2m_s^2)$ responsible for parity violation
in the soft breaking sector. 
The lightest values for $m_s$ not excluded by direct collider searches are slightly above $100~{\rm GeV}$, 
and therefore $|N_A^i - \frac{3}{2} N^i |$ is limited to be less than $10^{-12}$. 


The next contraint to consider is the one that uses energy scale $\mu \sim \Lambda_{QCD}$. 
In order to do this, we have to beyond pure QED and include hadronic components 
in $J^\mu_{EM}$ (\ref{LV_induced_by_gauge_K}). Then, as discussed earlier in 
\cite{GrootNibbelink:2004za}, The LV SQED operator (\ref{LV_gauge}) gives rise to 
interaction of the spatial components of $N^\mu$, electric field, and the spatial component 
for the hadronic current, ${\cal L} = M^{-1}\epsilon_{ijk} N^i E^j J_{EM}^k$.
The average of such interaction inside the nucleus with spin $I$ leads to 
the effective Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}_{\rm eff}= \kappa \vec I\cdot \vec N$.
The stengrh of this
interaction $\kappa$ is given by a nuclear matrix element esitmated as a 
product of a typical value for the electric field inside a heavy nucleus times a characteristic 
nucleon momentum. Combined with a $10^{-32} {\rm GeV}$ level of sensitivity for 
$\Delta \omega_{LV}$ in the most advanced experiments \cite{clock1,clock2},
this results in a stringent bound on $|N^i|$:
\begin{equation}
\kappa \sim \frac{eE p_{\rm nucl}}{Mm_p} \sim \frac{Z^{1/3}\alpha}{M m_p{\rm fm}^3} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad
M_{19}^{-1}|N^i|< 10^{-9}.
\label{N_limit_nucl}
\end{equation}
Here $p_{\rm nucl}\sim {\rm fm}^{-1}$ is a typical nucleon momentum
inside a nucleus. A more refined nuclear calculation can be done 
for mercury and xenon nuclei used in \cite{clock1,clock2} if needed.

The interaction term proportional to $c^\mu$ in 
(\ref{H_eff}) induces the couplings of the electron angular 
momentum $j$ inside a paramagnetic atom to the spatial component of 
$N_A^\mu/2-N^\mu$, $\mathcal{H}_{\rm eff}= \kappa j_i (N^i_A/2-N^i) $. 
It is clear that in this case the characteristic scale connecting 
$\Delta \omega_{LV}$ with LV paramaters is the typical momentum 
of atomic electrons, $\mu \sim p_{\rm atomic} \sim \alpha m_e$. 
Apart from an overall coefficient, the atomic matrix element
 responsible for this interaction has the same strengh as the usual spin-orbit 
 interaction, resulting in the value of $\kappa$
 \begin{equation}
 \kappa \sim Z^2\alpha^2 \frac{\alpha^2 m_e^2}{M}\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad
M_{19}^{-1}|N^i-N_A^i/2|<10^{-2}.
 \label{N_limit_atom}
 \end{equation}

 The two most stringent limits, (\ref{b_limit}) and (\ref{N_limit_nucl}),
are sensitive to different linear combinations of $N^i$ and $N_A^i$ vectors,
thus imposing a similar strength constraints on $N^i$ and 
$N_A^i$ separately. In order to impose a constraint on $N_V^i$, one has to 
make further assumptions about $\delta_s$. 
In a full MSSM scenario (as opposed to its SQED subset), the parity is broken above the 
weak scale, and a non-zero $\delta_s $ at a percent level or larger is expected from the 
radiative corrections even if the boundary conditions at $M$ are parity conserving, 
$m_s^+(M) = m_s^-(M)$.
This provides the sensitivity to $n_V^i$ at the level of $10^{-10}$. 
Time-like component of $N$-vectors are also constrained from the following considerations: 
the motion of the Earth and the solar system introduces the dependence of the laboratory frame 
on the velocity relative to the fixed $N_\mu$ background. 
Therefore, a non-zero $N^0$ would "mix" with 
$N^i$ at $O(v/c) \sim 10^{-3}-10^{-4}$ level. As a result, 
$10^{-6}-10^{-8}$-level constraints can be 
imposed on $N_V^0$, $N_A^0$ and $N^0$. 



The limits explored so far do not use the fact that 
LV operators of dimension five break CPT, as the 
experiments \cite{clock1,clock2} are done with normal matter.
Some experiments, however, explicitly compare properties 
of electrons and positrons, and thus could also be used 
to constrain LV CPT-odd operators. 
For example, a $ d^0 $-proportional term in (\ref{H_eff})
induces the interaction of the
electron spin with the magnetic field,
and thus contributes to the anomalous magnetic
moment of the electrons and positrons. The difference of
the $g$-factors for electrons and positrons is limited at  
$O(10^{-12})$ level, $|g_{e}-g_{\bar e}|< 8\times 10^{-12}$ 
\cite{Mittleman:1999it}.  

Interaction Hamiltonian for electrons and positrons corrected by the 
CPT-odd $d^0$-proportional interaction takes the following form,
%%

~.
\end{equation}
Obviously, this limit is inferior to those derived from the searches of
the breakdown of rotational invariance \cite{clock1,clock2}.

It is interesting to note that the CPT-violating correction to
the magnetic moments of electrons and positrons arises in the LV SQED
even if the supersymmetry is unbroken. At first sight it seems to 
be at odds with Ferrara-Remiddi theorem which
forbids emergence of anomalous magnetic moment of the
electron in the strict SUSY limit \cite{Ferrara:1974wb}.
The main statement of the theorem is that 
the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, 
$e(4m)^{-1} \overline{\Psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \Psi \; F^{\mu\nu}$, must enter
as the highest component of some supermultiplet, and
no such supermultiplet exists \cite{Ferrara:1974wb}.
In the language of our paper, there are no higher dimensional 
SUSY operators in the superpotential or among K\"ahler terms that 
would induce the anomalous magnetic moment. 
It is easy to see, however, that this theorem also relies on Lorentz invariance.
Indeed, when SQED is extended by the LV operators, the anomalous magnetic moment in the 
form of $eM^{-1}N_-^\mu
	  \overline{\Psi} \widetilde{F}_{\mu\nu}
                    \gamma^\nu \gamma^5 \Psi$ arises as the highest component of 
supermultiplets corresponding to operators (\ref{LV_matter}).

Lorentz violation induced by $ T^{\mu\nu\rho} $ (\ref{LV_gauge_Tterm})
is also subject to experimental constraints. For example, 
a 3D vector formed from the components of $T^{\mu\nu\rho} $,
$ f^k=\epsilon_{ijk} T^{i0j}$, leads essentially to the same effects as 
$c^k$ vector, and is subject to bounds analagous to (\ref{N_limit_nucl}) and 
(\ref{N_limit_atom}). Other components of $ T^{\mu\nu\rho} $ can be limited using  
their contributions to $f^k$ caused by the Earth motion effects. 

Finally, we would like to assert that limits on dimension 6 operators 
{\em are not} going to rule out LV modifications at $M^{-2}_{\rm Pl}$ level. 
Many of the operators listed in (\ref{LV_dim6_Fterm}) and (\ref{LV_dim6_Dterm})
contain an antisymmetric tensors.  After the inclusion of supersymmetry breaking, 
such terms can mix with $m_e\bar \psi \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi$ operator, leading to 
the LV spin precession of the electron. Assuming that the size of the dimensionless 
tensors in (\ref{LV_dim6_Fterm}) and (\ref{LV_dim6_Dterm}) is $O(1)$, one can 
derive the level of sensitivity to $M$ via the dimension six LV operators,
$
M^2 \sim m_em_s^2/(10^{-28}~{\rm GeV}), 
$
which translates to $M \sim 10^{14}$ GeV for $m_s \sim 100$ GeV, which is 
lower than the Planck scale. On the other hand we notice that in the 
framework of the LV MSSM the sensitivity to $M$ via dimension six LV operators 
wil be higher when the observables in the quark sector are employed. Indeed, 
we expect $m_e$ to be substuted by $m_q$ and $10^{-28}~{\rm GeV}$ 
by $10^{-32}~{\rm GeV}$ as the experiments searching for the anomalous 
spin precession of nucleons are intrinsically more precise. 
In this case we observe that the sensitivity to $M$  comes close to
the Planck scale, and future increase of the experimental sensitivity 
may probe this type of models. Although undoubtedly very interesting,
more detailed study of the observational consequences of 
dimension six LV operators goes beyond the scope of the present paper. 



\section{Discussion and Conclusions}

We have constructed the Lorentz-violating extension of supersymmetric quantum electrodynamics,
as a subset of the LV MSSM. The LV modification are power-like 
suppressed by the scale of the UV physics,
and decouple in the limit of $M\to \infty$. 

In the leading order in the ultraviolet parameter $M^{-1}$, 
dimension 5 LV operators can be coupled to
two types of the LV backgrounds. There are three four-vectors 
$N^\mu$, $N^\mu_+$ and $N^{\mu}_-$
that parametrize Lorentz violation for vector and chiral superfields, 
as well as the irreducible rank three tensor $T^{\mu\nu\lambda}$, 
antisymmetric in $\nu\lambda$. All operators coupled to these 
backgrounds are CPT-odd. At the next, dimension 6 level, the
LV operators are CPT-even, and their classification is given in 
this paper. 

We have explored uantum effects in the presence of the 
LV terms. We show that the anomaly cancellation condition 
is not altered by the presence of LV, neither is the $D$-term 
induced in the limit of exact SUSY. 
The renormalization group equations for LV operators of dimension five are derived 
in the limits of exact and softly-broken SUSY. In the case of exact supersymmetry, 
the mixing of operators and their logarithmic evolution over the energy scales are 
found at one loop. Once the SUSY is broken, the generation of dimension 
three operators become possible. The energy scale that controls the transmutation 
of dimension five LV operators into dimension three is the scale of the soft-breaking masses. 
In other words, quadratic divergencies that pose a naturalness problem for the 
SM extended by higher-dimensional LV operators are stabilized at the scale of the 
SUSY breaking, and thus the naturalness problem is alleviated. 
In order to obtain phenomenologically relevant formulae, we broke supersymmetry in the
scalar electron sector, and calculated the resulting LV effective Lagrangian for the 
electrons. We also checked that the corresponding dimension 3 operator for photons, 
the Chern-Simons term, is not generated at the loop level. 

We have obtained the explicit expressions in 
component form for LV interactions generated by these 
backgrounds that allow us to derive the observational consequences of Lorentz
violation in this model. Using the the results of the high-precision 
search for the LV spin interaction, we derive 
stringent limits on the linear combination of LV parameters in the 
SQED. The most stringent results come from the one-loop-generated 
coupling between the electron axial vector current and the external 
4-vector, given by the linear combination of $N^\mu$, $N^\mu_+$ and $N^{\mu}_-$,
 and use the absence of the anomalous spin precession for 
electrons checked at better than $10^{-28}$ GeV level in the 
torsion balance experiment \cite{Heckel:1999sy}. 
Assuming that the UV scale is the same order of magnitude as the Planck scale, 
we can constrain one linear combination of $N^i$, $N^i_+$ and $N^i_-$
at the level better than $O(10^{-12})$. Conversely, if we insist on $N^i \sim O(1)$, 
experiment \cite{Heckel:1999sy} provides a sensitivity to the LV ultraviolet scale that 
is more than ten orders of magnitude {\em larger} than the Planck scale. 
Other precision experiments \cite{clock1,clock2} also provide very stringent constraints on 
different linear combinations of the LV background vectors and components 
of irreducible tensor $T^{\mu\nu\lambda}$.

It is also remarkable that none of the 
operators considered in this paper lead to high-energy modifications of dispersion relations. 
Therefore, none of the stringent astrophysics-derived limits on LV parameters 
\cite{Ted1,GK} apply to the case of LV SQED. This also refers to potentially very strong 
constraints that exist for the Chern-Simons term \cite{CFJ}. We have also presented 
some arguments why the Chern-Simons term is not generated in loop corrections 
 even if the supersymmetry is broken. 
 
The existence of very strong constraints on Lorentz violation 
at dimension 5 level (with or without supersymmetry), 
poses a very serious challenge for theories that predict LV at $1/M_{\rm Pl}$ level. 
Therefore such theories are either ruled out or would necessarily 
abandon the effective low-energy field theory description,
which does not look to us as a reasonable alternative. However, it might be that dimension 
five operators are forbidden by some additional symmetry reasons, such as {\em i.e.} CPT. 
Then in the next order, $O(M^{-2})$ Planck-scale-suppressed LV effects 
are not excluded. The best constraints may come close \cite{Gagnon:2004xh},
 but applicable only to 
operators that modify high-energy dispersion relations. We classified 
dimension six LV operators in SQED and found that they 
couple to symmetric or antisymmetric two-index tensor
backgrounds. At the next step one can study their transmutation to dimension four 
operators in the presence of the soft-breaking terms. Naturally, we expect the 
scale of the transmutation is controlled by the soft breaking scale, 
which gives the estimate for the size of the 
LV backgrounds at dimension four as $m_s^2/M^2 \sim 10^{-32}$
for $m_s\sim1$ TeV and $M\sim 10^{19}$ GeV. We notice that this prediction 
comes close to the experimental sensitivity to such operators,
and therefore deserves further studies in the framework of LV MSSM.

%preserve SUSY exactly. These results are presented in the two 
%component spinor formulation. For phenomenological applications below

\section{Reduction of chiral LV operators on equations of motion}
\label{app_reduction}
%Here we show the explicit form of operators (\ref{LV_matter})
%\[
% electron
%\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{LV}}^{\mathrm{matter}} = 
%           \frac{i}{M} N_+^\mu\, \overline{\Phi}_+ e^{2eV} 
%\nabla_\mu \Phi_+ 
%~~
% positron
%-~~ \frac{i}{M} N_-^\mu\, 
%                          \Phi_- e^{-2eV} \nabla_\mu 
%  \overline{\Phi}_-
%\]
%being written in components, after the reduction on the equations of motion.
%The representation of this operator with the use of Weyl spinors 
%is given by (\ref{LV_electron_comp}). The generalization of (\ref{LV_electron_comp})
%to $\Phi_-$ sector is trivial, 
%$ \Phi_+  \to \,\Phi_- ; ~~V       \to - V.
%$
%This is in accord with our definition (\ref{LV_matter}).
% in
%particular with the minus sign of the positron operator.
%We again note on this sign, that we could have chosen it
%differently.
%And that might have seemed more natural from the point
%of view of antichiral or vector representation, when
%drawing an analogy of the electron operator to 
%all possible choices of the positron one (in fact,
%there are only two choices).
%But it is only our sign that leads to relations
%\ref{SYM_electron_positron}) and (\ref{SQED_electron_positron})
%ithout reverting the sign of the overall expression.

%Our first step is to resolve for the auxiliary fields
%  $ D $, $ F_\pm $
%in these operators to the first order in Lorentz 
%violation.
%This is done by considering the full lagrangian
%with all the kinetic terms and with the mass terms:

%(we assume $ {\mathrm Tr}\, T^a T^b = \frac{1}{2}\, \delta^{ab} $).
The component expression for Lorentz violating terms in the chiral sector are given
in (\ref{LV_electron_comp}). They can be tranformed further 
by the elimination of the auxiliary fields and higher derivatives 
via the equations of motion. Writing the result in terms of Dirac
four-spinors, we get the following rather lengthy expression:
%fermions by exploiting (\ref{Dirac_spinors}):

First, second and the last term in (A1) enter the 
reduced Lagrangian (\ref{}) that involves only electrons,
positrons and photons. A rather lentgthy form of (A1)
and a large number of diagrams that these 
interactions can create underlines the superiority of the 
superfield method over the component calculations for 
all processes with momenta larger than $m_s$.

\section{Conventions and notations}
\label{app_conventions}

Our notations for the superfield formalism are based on 
Wess \& Bagger 
\cite{Wess:1992cp}.
For conversion between Weyl and Dirac spinors we use the notations
of 
\cite{Martin:1997ns}.
Covariant derivatives and hermitean conjugation are taken from
\cite{Gates:1983nr}
with a proper adaptation. The signature of the metric is 
$ (-+++) $.
All spinor algebra definitions can be found in 
\cite{Wess:1992cp},
and we list here only some minor conventional departures.

Unlike in \cite{Wess:1992cp}, we denote the space-time Lorentz
indices with the letters from the middle of the \emph{greek}
alphabet:
$ v_\mu $, $ \sigma_\nu $, $ N^\rho $, etc,
as it is normally accustomed in QFT.
Spinor indices are taken, also as commonly accepted, from the
beginning of the greek alphabet:
$ \theta^\alpha $, $ \epsilon_{\beta\gamma} $, 
$ \overline{\psi}_{\dot\delta}$.
Spinor derivatives are designated as
%%
%% spinor derivatives
\[
\partial_\alpha = \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta^\alpha}\,,
\qquad
\partial^\alpha \equiv \epsilon^{\alpha\beta}\partial_\beta
\,.
\]

We use a notation with a slash in the case where a Lorentz
vector is contracted with a $ \sigma $-matrix, or a $ \gamma $-matrix:
\begin{equation}
\label{def_slashed}
\slashed{v} = v^\mu\, \sigma_\mu\;, \qquad
\overline{\slashed{A}} = A^\mu\, \overline{\sigma}_\mu\;, \qquad
\slashed{n} = n^\mu \gamma_\mu~~.
\end{equation}
%where the case of $ \sigma $-matrices is used with Weyl spinors, and
%the case of $ \gamma $-matrices is only used with Dirac spinors. 
%There should normally be no confusion as to which kind of spinor is
%meant in a particular expression.
%Note the appearance of the bar upon the slashed vector in
%(\ref{def_slashed}), when it
%is contracted with a $ \overline{\sigma}_\mu $.

For switching from Weyl to Dirac spinors we followed the notations of 
\cite{Martin:1997ns}.
Weyl representation for Dirac spinors is the most appropriate in this case,
where two Weyl spinors combine into one Dirac spinor:

%where the $ + $ or $ - $ superscript relates them to the
%{\it chiral} or {\it antichiral} representation 
%\cite{Gates:1983nr}
%correspondingly
%(in our case, this corresponds to the electron or the positron).
%The symbol $ \nabla^2 $ stands for $ \nabla^\alpha\, \nabla_\alpha $,
%not for $ \nabla^\mu\, \nabla_\mu $, and also
%should not be confused with the d'Alembertian, which we denote
%as:
%% Definition of d'Alembertian
%\[

For complex conjugation, we use the notion of 
\emph{hermitean conjugation} defined
in 
\cite{Gates:1983nr}.
When translated into the Wess \& Bagger notations, it implies
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
%%
%% definition of hermitean conjugation
\begin{eqnarray*}
\begin{array}{ll}
% first line
( \psi_\alpha )^\dagger = \overline{\psi}_{\dot\alpha}~,
&
\qquad
( \psi^\alpha )^\dagger = \overline{\psi}^{\dot\alpha}
\\
% second line
\partial_\alpha^\dagger = \overline{\partial}_{\dot\alpha}~,
&
\qquad
\partial_\mu^\dagger = -\, \partial_\mu 
\\
% third line
D_\alpha^\dagger = -\, \overline{D}_{\dot\alpha}~,
&
\qquad
( \nabla_\alpha^{\pm} )^\dagger = -\, 
\overline{\nabla}_{\dot\alpha}^\mp
\\
% fourth line
W_\alpha^\dagger = \overline{W}_{\dot\alpha}
\end{array}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.0}
\end{eqnarray*}
%Its basic principle is that in any expression being
%conjugated {\it all} objects must be put in the reverse order:
%%
%% examples of the conjugation principle
%\begin{eqnarray*}
% first line
% \left( \overline{\Phi}_1 \partial_\mu \Phi_2 \right)^\dagger
%& = & 
%-\, \overline{\Phi}_2 \partial_\mu \Phi_1 \\
% second line
%\left(
%\chi \sigma_\mu \overline{\psi}
%\right)^\dagger
%& = &
%\phantom{-\, }
%\psi \sigma_\mu \overline{\chi} \\
% third line
%\left(
%\chi \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi 
%\right)^\dagger
%& = &
%-\, \overline{\psi} \overline{\sigma}_{\mu\nu} \overline{\chi}~.
%\end{eqnarray*}

Finally, the expansion of the chiral superfields of SQED in components is
defined as
%%
%%
\[
	\Phi_\pm ~=~ z_\pm ~+~ \theta\psi_\pm ~+~ \theta^2 F_\pm
\]
while the vector fields in the Wess-zumino gauge is given by
\[
	V ~=~  -~ \theta\, \slashed{v}\, \overline{\theta} ~+~
		i \theta^2\, \overline{\theta}\overline{\lambda} 
		~-~
		i \overline{\theta}{}^2\, \theta\lambda
		~+~
		\frac{1}{2}
		\theta^2\overline{\theta}{}^2\, D~.
